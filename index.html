	Many
	varieties of styles, sizes, shapes, colors and textures of ceramic tile and stone
	are available today. The choice of multiple tile characteristics, combined with
	a wide variety of installation techniques, can make the selection process daunting
	for the homeowner as well as the seasoned professional.

		<b>Thomas Coates</b> - <i>Senior Tile Consultant</i></div>
	As a tile contractor and a general contractor, I have been dealing with these and
	other questions for more than thirty years. Most clients have no idea the impact
	that a particular tile choice would have on the correct layout, trim to be used,
	or method of installation necessary with each project. <b>Northwest Tile Consultingâ€™s</b>
	objective is to aid with our expert advice, saving your valuable time.
